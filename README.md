MonoTouch Bindings for PSPDFKit v2.8.7
======================================

This project provides bindings for use in MonoTouch (iOS 5.0 and above) for the PSPDFKit PDF Library (www.pspdfkit.com).
The bindings are provided for version 2.8.7 of PSPDFKit. (But future versions generally work as well)

There are two examples, one for basic usage, one showing how to do subclassing.
